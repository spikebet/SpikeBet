    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>General Questions</h2>
        
        <div class="question">What is Spike Play?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            Spike Play is a sweepstakes-based platform where users make predictions on Track & Field
            events. It is designed for entertainment purposes only and does not involve gambling, betting, or
            wagering.
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">Is Spike Play legal?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            Yes. Spike Play operates under a sweepstakes model that complies with applicable laws. No
            purchase is necessary to participate, and making a purchase does not increase your chances of
            winning.
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">How do I participate?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            To participate, create an account and use either Spike Coins (for social play) or Spike Cash
            (for sweepstakes entries). Predictions are placed using these virtual currencies, and winnings
            are distributed according to our rules.

        <h2>Spike Coins & Spike Cash</h2>
        
        <div class="question">What is the difference between Spike Coins and Spike Cash?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spike Coins:</strong> A virtual currency used for free social play. They have no real-world value
                and cannot be redeemed for prizes.</li>
                <li><strong>Spike Cash:</strong> A sweepstakes currency used to enter contests for a chance to win
                redeemable prizes.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">How do I earn Spike Cash?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            Spike Cash can be obtained in several ways:
            <ol>
                <li>Daily login rewards</li>
                <li>Promotional giveaways</li>
                <li>Bonus rewards with certain purchases of Spike Coins</li>
                <li>Mail-in requests (as outlined in our official rules)</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">Can I buy Spike Cash?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            No. Spike Cash is only available through free methods, such as giveaways or as an occasional bonus with
            Spike Coin purchases.
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">How does redemption work?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            Only Used Spike Cash—earned through winning in sweepstakes contests—can be redeemed
            for real-world prizes. A minimum of 20 Used Spike Cash is required for withdrawal.

        <h2>Making Predictions & Winnings</h2>
        
        <div class="question">How do I make a prediction?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            Select an event, choose an outcome, and enter with either Spike Coins or Spike Cash. Entries
            go into a shared pool, and winnings are distributed among those with correct predictions.
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">How are payouts determined?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            Payouts are calculated based on the total pool of entries and the number of correct predictions.
            The minimum payout is always equal to the amount of Spike Cash or number of Spike Coins you use to enter, provided
            you are the only winner.
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">Are there different payout structures for "To Win," "Top 2," and "Top 3" picks?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            Yes, but we do not display odds, as payout amounts fluctuate until the event concludes. Final
            winnings are determined based on total entries and correct picks.
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">What happens if an athlete does not start or does not finish a race?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Did Not Start (DNS):</strong> Your entry is refunded.</li>
                <li><strong>Did Not Finish (DNF):</strong> The athlete is considered to have finished last. "Over" time picks
                are marked as wins, while "Under" and placement picks are marked as losses.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">Can I get a refund on my entries or purchases?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            No. All purchases and contest entries are final.
